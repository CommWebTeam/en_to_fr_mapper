<p>This tool tries to fill in the wet French document after the wet English document has been manually completed. It works on the assumptions that a) the original (non-wet) documents have similar document structures and b) the wet html documents should have identical structures. With that in mind, it replaces the English values in the wet html document with their equivalent French values.</p>
<p>If the console shows anything especially strange (0 lines, the entire document being unmatched, etc.), try clicking through the buttons more slowly (some of this is asynchronous).</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Part 1 - get contents from dirty documents</li>
  <ol>
    <li>In Word, stop tracking changes.</li>
    <li>You may want to save copies of the documents before doing this - remove formatting from both the English and French word documents (ctrl+shift+n). This should make the contents a bit easier to align. Depending on the document, ctrl+6 to remove filled in values may be helpful, but it also removes links.</li>
    <li>Paste these documents as HTML files into the Dreamweaver design view in separate files.</li>
    <li>Upload these two HTML files.</li>
    <li>Download the values that are generated (these are the html documents with the tags removed).</li>
    <li>Make sure there are exactly the same number of English and French values (number of values is printed in the console) since the next part matches by index.</li>
    <li>If they don't, manually add blank rows to the shorter document in the positions where the corresponding English and French values don't align. (It's better to add lines to the English content than remove them so you don't miss any matches. Either adding or removing lines is fine for the French content.) Any editor with row numbers is fine for this.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Part 2 - replace english contents in cleaned english document with french contents</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Upload the values after you've made sure they align.</li>
    <li>Upload the English document that was formatted by WET standards.</li>
    <li>Download the French document that should now be formatted by WET standards.</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Pasting word documents into Dreamweaver does NOT include superscripts and subscripts</strong> - you will have to add these in manually.</p>
      <p>Lines that include &lt;sub&gt; or &lt;sup&gt; have been marked by SUPERSCRIPTORSUBSCRIPT. Go through the document and search for SUPERSCRIPTORSUBSCRIPT to manually add in superscripts and subscripts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Make sure to double check with beyond compare as usual.</p>
      <p>One common issue with the mapper is that punctuation differences between English and French contents (e.g. a period is bolded in the English version only) may result in duplicate / missing punctuation or spacing, so it could be worth manually searching for strings like <i>" ."</i>, <i>" ,"</i>, <i>".."</i>, and <i>". ."</i> to remove first.</p>
      <p>Also, you may want to manually remove any empty tags generated by blank french content lines afterwards.</p></li>
  </ol>
